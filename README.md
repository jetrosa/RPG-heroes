### Noroff Java assignment

RPG-Heroes is a Maven application in Java. It is a game model without the actual game.
It doesn't have any real main method, the behavior of the classes is verified through unit testing.
The purpose of the project is to practice OOP-concepts, basic Java and unit testing.

The project includes four hero classes: mage, ranger, rogue and warrior. Heroes can equip armor and weapons and 
they can gain levels to increase their attributes and access more items (fulfilling the level requirements). 
The heroes differ by their attributes, weapon and armor types. 
Hero damage is calculated using attributes from leveling, equipped items and weapon damage.
